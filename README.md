A. Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an image classification model for identifying medicinal plants using digital images. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of different medicinal plant species, grouped into 20 classes. By learning visual features such as leaf shape, color, texture, and structure, the model can automatically classify an input image into the correct medicinal plant category.

The purpose of this image classification model is to assist in the accurate and efficient identification of medicinal plants. This system can help students, researchers, and the general public recognize medicinal plants without requiring expert botanical knowledge. It also aims to support applications in education, conservation, traditional medicine documentation, and mobile or web-based plant identification tools.
